# flipcoin

The *FlipCoin* is a simple application to show random number usage.

The game guesses Heads or Tails randomly. A user tries to guess what
has been guessed by sending a corresponding `flip-coin` transaction to
the application.  If the user sends the value (Heads or Tails) which is
the same as the guessed one, s/he wins the game.

For simplicity reasons a user can flip a coin once per block only..
