### Arcade reseeding draft


##### Overview

Any system that generates randomness is expected to have an external source of entropy. Currently Arcade generates cryptographically random values; this document describes the expected model of external randomness in Arcade.    

##### Basic assumptions

Arcade is a modification of Tendermint that adds some random data to each block generated by consensus. The data is cryptographically random: each validator uses its share of a common tBLS key to sign the "random" value from the previous block, and until the required (t) number of signatures is received, the exact value of the recovered common signature remains unknown. If there was no source of external randomness, it would be possible for an attacker to examine multiple blocks and get an idea of the common (full) secret key. If we could add a random seed to each block's generated value, that would make the attacker's job harder; however, generating a random value is not an easy task that can be done within a block's generation time, so the best solution available is just to do reseeding as often as possible.      

##### The Model

We suggest that reseeding is done done via querying an external source (`S`) for a known value (`V`); e.g., Bitcoin's block hashes are considered to be good random values, so this value might be used for our purposes.

The algorithm is described as follows:

1. Each validator queries `S` for `V` in the beginning of each voting round, the concrete mechanism is dependant on the nature of `S` â€” for example, in the case of Bitcoin `V` can be the hash of the last block that has at least `n` confirmations;
2. `V` is attached to prevote messages and is distributed among participants;
3. If the value is correct, validators attach the agreed upon value to precommit messages, if not (i.e., , they complain by sending evidence of misbehaviour to other participants;
4. If we have `2/3+1` seeds, the generated block's random data is calculated not as `r_{n+1} = tbls(r_{n})` (the usual flow), but as `rs_{n+1} = tbls(sha256(r_{n} || seed))`.
